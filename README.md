# GetTaxi_Excel_Analysis
Data analysis of cancelled orders using Excel
# Objective
In this analysis, we would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that were not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car.
# Data
Open source data that covers failed orders throughout one day.
# Tools
Excel, Power Point
# Insights & Recommendations
There are three evident periods of time during the day when the number of cancelled orders is rising. Two of them are when people moving to and from the office, e.g. 7 am - 9 am and 4 pm – 6 pm. and then at late hours 10 pm – 12 am. 
The estimated arrival time has the rising trend during these hours across the day.
While the cancelation time doesn’t show significant variations throughout the day. However, the cancellation time has downward trend during the rush hours.
As long and the arrival time increases, the more orders are being canceled. 
The time the customers spend for ride are extremely crucial for them and the clients are not willing to wait for the driver’s arrival for more than 5 min. 
Since rhe arrival time is of primary importance for customers, I would sugest introducing the improvements to match better the driver and the customer’s location and reduce the waiting time.
Estimate and increase the number of drivers during the rush hours.
Assuming that the arriving time may be affected by the traffic jam during the rush hour, improve the logistics to avoid overloaded roads.
Elaborate the compensations program or cash reward in case the driver has arrived later that the estimated time with the reasonable margin of allowance.
# Further steps
I assume that the two major factors that may affect the customers’ loyalty which are rite time and the cost of the ride.
In addition to the relationship between canceled orders and the expected arriving time, the following factors should be analyzed:
The estimated and real time of arrival.
The cancelled orders and the declared cost.
The variation of orders placed and the number of drivers who are ready to provide taxi services throughout the day, week.
Analyze the trends on working days and weekends separately.
Analyze the location of customers and the real disposition of the drivers during the busiest hours. Look at the insights that can provide the special analysis.
